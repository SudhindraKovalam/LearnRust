# Hello World

## Notes
- This is a simple "Hello World" program in Rust.
- Generated using the `cargo new` command.

## Code
- Functions are defined using the `fn` keyword.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- Like C/C++, Rust uses curly braces `{}` to define blocks of code.
- Rust has hygienic macros, which are similar to C/C++ macros but safer and more powerful. For example, the `println!` macro is used to print to the console.
- Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded and can contain any Unicode character.
