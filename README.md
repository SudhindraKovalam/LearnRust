A Repo to  learn Rust


## Rust Ecosystem
- [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)

## Tools
- `rustc`: The Rust compiler.
- `cargo`: Rust dependency manager and build tool. Cargo knows how to download dependencies and pass them to `rustc`. It also has an inbuild test runnner which can be used to execute unit tests
- `rustup` : The rust toolchain installer and updater. This tool is used to install and update the Rust toolchain (`rustc` and `cargo`). You can have multiple versions of Rust installed at the same time and switch between them easily using `rustup`.
